\chapter*{Preface}

This is a brief description of the TimblAPI class and its main
functions.  Not everything found in {\tt TimblAPI.h} is
described. Some functions are still "work in progress" and some others
are artefacts to simplify the implementation of the TiMBL main
program\footnote{Timbl.cxx is therefore {\em not} a good example of
  how to use the API.}.  To learn more about using the API, you should
study programs such as {\tt classify.cxx}, {\tt tse.cxx}, and the
examples given in this manual, which can all be found in the {\tt demos}
directory of this distribution.

As you can readily gather from these examples, the basic thing you
need to do to get access to the TimblAPI functions is to include {\tt
  TimblAPI.h} in the program, and to include {\tt libTimbl.a} in your
linking path.

{\bf Important note}: The described functions return a result (mostly
a bool) to indicate succes or failure. To simplify the examples, we
ignore these return values. This is, of course, bad practice, to be avoided in
real life programming.\footnote{as stated by commandment 6 of ``The
  Ten Commandments for C Programmers''' by Henry Spencer:	

If a function be advertised to return an error code in the event of
difficulties, thou shalt check for that code, yea, even though the
checks triple the size of thy code and produce aches in thy typing
fingers, for if thou thinkest ``it cannot happen to me'', the gods
shall surely punish thee for thy arrogance.}

{\bf Warning}: Although the TiMBL internals perform some sanity
checking, it is quite possible to combine API functions such
that some undetermined state is reached, or even a conflict
arises. The effect of the {\tt SetOptions()} function, for instance,
might be quite surprising. If you have created your own program
with the API it might be wise to test against well-know data to see if
the results make sense.

\chapter{Changes}
\label{changes}

\section{From version 6.2 to 6.3}

No changes to the API are made for this release. This Manual is made up to date though. (preserving the beta-state).
 
\section{From version 6.1 to 6.2}

In version 6.2, some additional functions were added to the API: {\tt
  matchDepth()}, {\tt matchedAtLeaf()}, {\tt WriteMatrices()}, {\tt
  GetMatrices()} and {\tt ShowStatistics()}. These reflect the
additional functionality of Timbl 6.2.  The API is still experimental,
and contains more functions than described in this manual. Using these
'undocumented' features is, as usual, unwise.

\section{From version 5.1 to 6.1}

The major change in 6.0 is the introduction of the {\tt neighborSet}
class, with some special Classify functions.  We added Classify
functions that deliver pointers into Timbl's internal data. This is
fast, but dangerous.  Also, a {\tt WriteInstanceBaseXml()} function is
added, which comes in handy when you want to know more about the
instance base.  Two more examples demonstrating neighborSets and such
are added in Appendix B. From version 6.0 to 6.1, the API has not changed.

\section{From version 5.0 to 5.1}

The API is quite stable at the moment. Most TiMBL changes did not
affect the API. The only real API change is in the {\tt GetWeights()}
function. (see the section on Storing and retrieving intermediate
results).  A few options were added to Timbl, influencing the table in
Appendix A. We have also changed and enhanced the examples in Appendix
B.

\chapter{Quick-start}
\section{Setting up an experiment}

There is just one way to start a TiMBL experiment, which is to call
the TimblAPI constructor:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  TimblAPI( const std::string& args, const std::string& name ="" );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

args is used as a "command line" and is parsed for all kind of options
which are used to create the right kind of experiment with the desired
settings for metric, weighting etc. If something is wrong with the
settings, {\em no}\/ object is created.

The most important option is {\tt -a}  to set the kind of algorithm,
e.g. {\tt -a IB1} to invoke an IB1 experiment or {\tt -a IGTREE} to invoke an IGTREE
experiment. A list of possible options is give in Appendix A.

The optional name can be useful if you have multiple experiments.
In case of warnings or errors, this name is appended to the message.

For example:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  TimblAPI *My_Experiment = new TimblAPI( "-a IGTREE +vDI+DB", 
                                          "test1" );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

{\tt My\_Experiment} is created as an IGTREE experiment with the name
"test1", and the verbosity is set to DI+DB, meaning that the output
will contain DIstance and DistriBution information.

The counterpart to creation is the {\tt \~{ }TimblAPI()} destructor,
which is called when you delete an experiment:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  delete My_Experiment;
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

\section{Running an experiment}

Assuming that we have appropriate datafiles (such as the example files {\tt
dimin.train} and {\tt dimin.test} in the TiMBL package), we can get
started right away with the functions {\tt Learn()} and {\tt Test()}.

\subsection{Training}
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  bool Learn( const std::string& f );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

This function takes a file with name 'f', and gathers information
such as: number of features, number and frequency of feature values and
the same for class names. After that, these data are used to calculate
a lot of statistical information, which will be used for
testing. Finally, an InstanceBase is created, tuned to the current
algorithm.

\subsection{Testing}
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  bool Test( const std::string& in,
             const std::string& out,
             const std::string& perc = "" );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Test a file given by 'in' and write results to 'out'. If 'perc' is not
empty, then a percentage score is written to file 'perc'.

For example:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  My_Experiment->Learn( "dimin.train" );  
  My_Experiment->Test( "dimin.test", "my_first_test" );  
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

An InstanceBase will be created from dimin.train, then dimin.test is
tested against that InstanceBase and output is written to
my\_first\_test.

\subsection{special cases of Learing and Testing}

There are special cases where {\tt Learn()} behaves differently:

\begin{itemize}
\item When the algorithm is IB2, {\tt Learn()} will automatically take
  the first $n$ lines of f (set with the {\tt -b n} option) to
  bootstrap itself, and then the rest of f for IB2-learning. After
  Learning IB2, you can use {\tt Test()} as usual.

\item When the algorithm is CV, {\tt Learn()} is not defined, and all
  work is done in a special version of {\tt Test()}. 'f' is assumed to
  give the name of a file, which, on separate lines, gives the names
  of the files to be cross-validated.

  Also, if {\em featureWeights}\/ or {\em probabilities}\/ are read from 
  user-defined datafiles, a special {\tt CVprepare()} function must be called, 
  to make the weigthing, weightFilename and probabilityFileName known to the 
{\tt Test()} function.

See Appendix B for a complete CV example (program {\tt api\_test3}).

%TODO: een voorbeeld met CVPrepare erbij!

\end{itemize}

\section{More about settings}

After an experiment is set up with the TimblAPI constructor, many
options can be changed "on the fly" with:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  bool SetOptions( const std::string& opts );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Here, 'opts' is interpreted as a list of option settings, just like in
the TimblAPI constructor. When an error in the opts string is found,
{\tt SetOptions()} returns false. Whether any options are really set
or changed in that case is undefined. Note that a few options can only
be set {\em once}\/ when creating the experiment, most notably the
algorithm. Any attempt to change these options will result in a
failure.  See Appendix A for all valid options and information about
the possibility to change them within a running experiment.

Note: {\tt SetOptions()} is "lazy"; changes are cached until the
moment they are really needed, so you can do several {\tt SetOptions()}
calls with even different values for the same option. Only the last
one seen will be used for running the experiment.

To see which options are in effect, you can use the calls {\tt ShowOptions()}
and {\tt ShowSettings()}.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  bool ShowOptions( std::ostream& );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Shows all options with their possible and current values.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  bool ShowSettings( std::ostream& );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Shows all options and their currect values.

For example:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  My_Experiment->SetOptions( "-w2 -m:M" );
  My_Experiment->SetOptions( "-w3 -v:DB" );
  My_Experiment->ShowSettings( cout )
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

See Appendix B (program {\tt api\_test1}) for the output.

\section{Storing and retrieving intermediate results}

To speed up testing, or to manipulate what is happening internally, we
can store and retrieve several important parts of our experiment: The
InstanceBase, the FeatureWeights, the ProbabilityArrays and the ValueDistance Matrices.

Saving is done with:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  bool WriteInstanceBase( const std::string& f );
  bool SaveWeights( const std::string& f );
  bool WriteArrays( const std::string& f );
  bool WriteMatrices( const std::string& f );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Retrieve with their counterparts:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  bool GetInstanceBase( const std::string& f );
  bool GetWeights( const std::string& f, Weighting w );
  bool GetArrays( const std::string& f );
  bool GetMatrices( const std::string& f );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

All use 'f' as a filename for storing/retrieving. {\tt GetWeights} needs
information to decide {\em which}\/ weighting to retrieve.
Weighting is defined as the enumerated type:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  enum Weighting { UNKNOWN_W, UD, NW, GR, IG, X2, SV };
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Some notes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The InstanceBase is stored in a internal format, with or without
hashing, depending on the {\tt -H} option. The format is described in the
TiMBL manual. Remember that it is a bad idea to edit this file in any way.
\item {\tt GetWeights()} can be used to override the weights that
{\tt Learn()} calculated. {\tt UNKNOWN\_W} should not be used.
\item The Probability arrays are described in the TiMBL manual. They can be
manipulated to tune the MVDM similarity metric.
\end{enumerate}

If you like you may dump the Instancebase in an XML format. No Retrieve
function is available for this format.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  bool WriteInstanceBaseXml( const std::string& f );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

\chapter{Getting the details}

\section{Classify functions: elementary}
After an experiment is trained with {\tt Learn()}, we do not have to use
{\tt Test()} to do bulk-testing on a file.
We can create our own tests with the {\tt Classify} functions:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  bool Classify( const std::string& Line, std::string& result );
  bool Classify( const std::string& Line, std::string& result, 
                 double& distance );
  bool Classify( const std::string& Line, std::string& result,
                 std::string& Distrib, double& distance );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Results are stored in 'result' (the assigned class). 'distance' will
get the calculated distance, and 'Distrib' the distribution at
'distance' which is used to calculate 'result'.  Distrib will be a
string like ``\{ NP 2, PP 6 \}''. It is up to you to parse and
interpret this. (In this case: There were 8 classes assigned at
'distance', 2 NP's and 6 PP's, giving a 'result' of ``PP''.)

If you want to perform analyses on these distributions, it might be a
good idea to read the next section about the other range of Classify()
functions.

A main disadvantage compared to using {\tt Test()} is that {\tt
  Test()} is optimized.  {\tt Classify()} has to test for sanity of
its input and also whether a {\tt SetOptions()} has been
performed. This slows down the process.

A good example of the use of {\tt Classify()} is the {\tt
 classify.cxx} program in the TiMBL Distribution.

Depending on the Algorithm and Verbosity setting, it may be possible
to get some extra information on the details of each classification
using:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
   const bool ShowBestNeighbors( std::ostream& os, bool distr ) const;
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Provided that the option {\tt +v n} or {\tt +v k} is set and we use
IB1 or IB2, output is produced similar to what we see in the TiMBL
program.  When 'distr' is true, their distributions are also
displayed.  Bear in mind: The {\tt +vn} option is expensive in time
and memory and does not work for IGTREE, TRIBL, and TRIBL2.

Two other functions provide the results as given by the {\tt +vmd} verbosity 
option:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
    size_t matchDepth() const;
    bool matchedAtLeaf() const;
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

The first returns the matching Depth in the InstanceBase; the second 
flags whether it was a Leaf or a Non-Terminal Node.

\section{Classify functions: advanced}

A faster, but more dangerous version of Classify is also available.
It is faster because it returns pointers into Timbl's internal
datastructures. It is dangerous because it returns pointers into
Timbl's internal datastructures (using 'const' pointers, so it is
fortunately difficult te really damage Timbl)

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  const TargetValue *Classify( const std::string& );
  const TargetValue *Classify( const std::string&, 
                               const ValueDistribution *& );
  const TargetValue *Classify( const std::string&, double& );
  const TargetValue *Classify( const std::string&, 
                               const ValueDistribution *&, 
                               double& );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

A ValueDistribution is a list-like object (but it is not a real list!)
that contains TargetValues objects and weights. It is the result of
combining all nearest neighbors and applying the desired weightings.
Timbl chooses a best TargetValue from this ValueDistribution and the
Classify functions return that as their main result.

{\bf Important}: Because these functions return pointers into Timbl's
internal representation, the results are only valid until the next
Classify function is called (or the experiment is deleted).

Both the TargetValue and ValueDistribution objects have output
operators defined, so you can print them.  TargetValue also has a {\tt
  Name()} function, which returns a std::string so you can collect
results.  ValueDistribution has an iterator-like interface which makes
it possible to walk through the Distribution.

An iterator on a {\tt ValueDistribution *vd} is created like this:
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  ValueDistribution::dist_iterator it=vd->begin();
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Unfortunately, the iterator cannot be printed or used directly.
It walks through a map-like structure with pairs of values, of which
only the {\tt second} part is of interest to you.
You may print it, or extract its {\tt Value()} (which happens to be a
TargetValue pointer) or extract its {\tt Weight()}, which is a {\tt double}.

Like this:
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  while ( it != vd->end() ){
    cout << it->second << " has a value: ";
    cout << it->second->Value() << " an a weight of "
         << it->second->Weight() << endl;
    ++it;
  }
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Printing {\tt it->second} is the same as printing the
TargetValue plus its Weight.

In the {\em demos}\/ directory you will find a complete example in api\_test6.

{\bf Warning}: it is possible to search the Timbl code for the
internal representation of the TargetValue and ValueDistribution
objects, but please DON'T DO THAT.  The representation might change
between Timbl versions.

\section{Classify functions: neighborSets}

A more flexible way of classifying is to use one of these functions:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  const neighborSet *classifyNS( const std::string& );
  bool classifyNS( const std::string&, neighborSet& );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

The first function will classify an instance and return a pointer to a
{\tt neighborSet} object. This object may be seen as an container
which holds both distances and distributions up to a certain depth,
(which is {\em at least}\/ the number of neighbors (-k option) that
was used for the classifying task.)  It is a const object, so you
cannot directly manipulate its internals, but there are some
functions defined to get useful information out of the neighborSet.

Important:  The neighborSet {\em will be overwritten}\/ on the next
call to any of the classify functions. Be sure to get all the
results out before that happens.

To make life easy, a second variant can be used, which fills a
neighborSet object that you provide (the same could be achieved by a
copy of the result of the first function). 

{\bf Note}: NeighborSets can be large, and copying therefore
expensive, so you should only do this if you really have to.

\subsection{How to get results from a neighborSet}

No metric functions (such as exponential decay and the like) are
performed on the neighborSet. You are free to insert your own metrics, or
use Timbls built-in metrics.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  double getDistance( size_t n ) const;
  double bestDistance() const;
  const ValueDistribution *getDistribution( size_t n ) const;
  ValueDistribution *bestDistribution( const decayStruct * ds=0,
                                       size_t n=0 ) const ;
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

{\tt getDistance( n )} will return the distance of the neighbor(s) at n.
{\tt bestDistance()} is simply {\tt getDistance(0)}.

{\tt getDistribution( n )} will return the distribution of neighbor(s) at
n.

{\tt bestDistribution()} will return the Weighted distribution
calculated using the first n elements in the container and a metric
specified by the {\tt decayStruct}.  The default n=0, means: use the
whole container. An empty decay struct means zeroDecay.

The returned ValueDistribution object is handed to you, and you are
responsible for deleting it after using it (see the previous section
for more details about ValueDistributions).

A decayStruct is one of:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  class zeroDecay();
  class invLinDecay();
  class invDistDecay();
  class expDecay( double alpha );
  class expDecay( double alpha, double beta );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}
 
For example, to get a ValueDistribution form a neighborSet {\tt nb}, using
3 neighbors and exponential decay with alpha=0.3, you can do:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  decayStruct *dc = new  expDecay(0.3);
  ValueDistribution *vd = nb->bestDistribution( dc, 3 );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}


\subsection{Usefull operations on neighborSet objects}

You can print neighborSet objects:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
    std::ostream& operator<<( std::ostream&, const neighborSet& );
    std::ostream& operator<<( std::ostream&, const neighborSet * );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

You may create a neighborSet yourself, and assign and delete them:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
    neighborSet();
    neighborSet( const neighborSet& );
    neighborSet& operator=( const neighborSet& );
    ~neighborSet();
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

If you create an neighborSet, you might want to reserve space for it,
to avoid needless reallocations. Also it can be cleared, and you can
ask the size (just like with normal containers):

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
    void reserve( size_t );
    void clear();
    size_t size() const;
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Two neighborSets can be merged:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
    void merge( const neighborSet& );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

A neighborSet can be truncated at a certain level. This is useful
after merging neighborSets. Merging sets with depth k and n will
result in a set with a depth somewhere within the range $[max(k,n), k+n]$.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
    void truncate( size_t );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

\chapter{Advanced Functions}

\section{Modifying the InstanceBase}

The instanceBase can be modified with the functions:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  bool Increment( const std::string& Line ); 
  bool Decrement( const std::string& Line ); 
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

These functions add an Instance (as described by Line) to the
InstanceBase, or remove it.  This can only be done for IB1-like
experiments (IB1, IB2, CV and LOO), and enforces a lot of
statistical recalculations.

More sophisticated are:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  bool Expand( const std::string& File  );
  bool Remove( const std::string& File );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

which use the contents of File to do a bulk of Increments or Decrements, and
recalculate afterwards.

\section{Getting more information out of Timbl}

There are a few convenience functions to get extra information on
TiMBL and its behaviour:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  bool WriteNamesFile( const std::string& f );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Create a file which resembles a C4.5 namesfile.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  Algorithm Algo()
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Give the current algorithm as a type enum Algorithm. First, the
declaration of the Algorithm type:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  enum Algorithm { UNKNOWN_ALG, IB1, IB2, IGTREE, 
                   TRIBL, TRIBL2, LOO, CV };
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

This can be printed with the helper function: 

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  const std::string to_string( const Algorithm )
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  Weighting CurrentWeighting()
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Gives the current weighting as a type enum Weighting.

Declaration of Weighting:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  enum Weighting { UNKNOWN_W, UD, NW, GR, IG, X2, SV };
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

This can be printed with the helper function: 

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  const std::string to_string( const Weighting )
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}


\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  Weighting CurrentWeightings( std::vector<double>& v )
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Returns the current weighting as a type enum Weighting and also a
vector v with all the current values of this weighting.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  std::string& ExpName()
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Returns the value of 'name' given at the construction of the experiment

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  static std::string VersionInfo( bool full = false )
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Returns a string containing the Version number, the Revision and the
Revision string of the current API implementation. If full is true,
also information about the date and time of compilation is included.

\chapter{Server Mode}
\label{Using TiMBL as a Server}

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
  bool StartServer( const int port, const int max_c );
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Starts a TimblServer on 'port' with maximally 'max\_c' concurrent
connections to it. Starting a server makes sense only after the
experiment is trained.

Warning:-test1-Metric must be Overlap for IGTree test.     [Note 3]

\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}


Notes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The {\tt -w2} of the first {\tt SetOptions()} is overruled with
  {\tt -w3} from the second {\tt SetOptions()}, resulting in a
  weighting of 3 or Chi-Square. 
\item The first {\tt SetOptions()} sets the verbosity with {\tt +F+DI+DB}.
The second {\tt SetOptions()}, however, sets the verbosity with {\tt -vDB}, and the resulting verbosity is therefore {\tt F+DI}.
\item Due to the second {\tt SetOptions()}, the default metric is set to
MVDM --- this is however not applicable to IGTREE. This raises a warning
when we start to test.

\subsection{example 2, {\tt api\_test2.cxx}}

This demonstrates IB2 learning. Our example program:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
#include "TimblAPI.h"
int main(){
  TimblAPI *My_Experiment = new TimblAPI( "-a IB2 +vF+DI+DB" , 
                                          "test2" );
  My_Experiment->SetOptions( "-b100" );
  My_Experiment->ShowSettings( std::cout );
  My_Experiment->Learn( "dimin.train" );  
  My_Experiment->Test( "dimin.test", "my_second_test.out" );
  delete My_Experiment;
  exit(1);
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

We create an experiment for the IB2 algorithm, with the {\tt -b} option set
to 100, so the first 100 lines of {\tt dimin.train} will be used to
bootstrap the learning, as we can see from the output:

Notes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item IB2 is bootstrapped with 100 lines, but for the statistics all 2999
 lines are used.
\item As we see here, 173 entries from the input file had a mismatch,
and were therefore entered in the Instancebase.
\item We see that IB2 scores 94.11 \%, compared to 96.21 \% for IGTREE
  in our first example.  For this data, IB2 is not a good
  algorithm. However, it saves a lot of space, and is faster than
  IB1. Yet, IGTREE is both faster and better. Had we used IB1, the
  score would have been 96.84 \%.

\subsection{example 3, {\tt api\_test3.cxx}}

This demonstrates Cross Validation. Let's try the following program:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
#include "TimblAPI.h"
using Timbl::TimblAPI;

int main(){
  TimblAPI *My_Experiment = new TimblAPI( "-t cross_validate" );
  My_Experiment->Test( "cross_val.test" );  
  delete My_Experiment;
  exit(0);
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

This program creates an experiment, which defaults to IB1 and because of the
special option ``-t cross\_validate'' will start a CrossValidation
experiment.\\
Learn() is not possible now. We must use a special form of Test().

``cross\_val.test'' is a file with the following content:
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
small_1.train
small_2.train
small_3.train
small_4.train
small_5.train

What has happened here?

\begin{enumerate}
\item TiMBL trained itself with inputfiles small\_2.train through
small\_5.train. (in fact using the {\tt Expand()} API call.
\item Then TiMBL tested small\_1.train against the InstanceBase.
\item Next, small\_2.train is removed from the database (API call {\tt
Remove()} ) and small\_1.train is added.
\item Then small\_2.train is tested against the InstanceBase.
\item And so forth with small\_3.train $\ldots$
\end{enumerate}
\clearpage

\subsection{example 4, {\tt api\_test4.cxx}}

This program demonstrates adding and deleting of the InstanceBase.  It
also proves that weights are (re)calculated correctly each time (which
also explains why this is a time-consuming thing to do). After running
this program, wg.1.wgt should be equal to wg.5.wgt and wg.2.wgt equal to
wg.4.wgt . Important to note is also, that while we do not use a weighting
of X2 or SV here, only the ``simple'' weights are calculated and
stored.

Further, arr.1.arr should be equal to arr.5.arr and arr.2.arr should be equal
to arr.4.arr

First the program: 

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
#include <iostream>
#include "TimblAPI.h"

int main(){
  TimblAPI *My_Experiment = new TimblAPI( "-a IB1 +vDI+DB +mM" , 
                                          "test4" );
  My_Experiment->ShowSettings( std::cout );
  My_Experiment->Learn( "dimin.train" );  
  My_Experiment->Test( "dimin.test", "inc1.out" );
  My_Experiment->SaveWeights( "wg.1.wgt" );  
  My_Experiment->WriteArrays( "arr.1.arr" );  
  My_Experiment->Increment( "=,=,=,=,+,k,e,=,-,r,@,l,T" );  
  My_Experiment->Test( "dimin.test", "inc2.out" );
  My_Experiment->SaveWeights( "wg.2.wgt" );  
  My_Experiment->WriteArrays( "arr.2.arr" );  
  My_Experiment->Increment( "+,zw,A,rt,-,k,O,p,-,n,O,n,E" );  
  My_Experiment->Test( "dimin.test", "inc3.out" );
  My_Experiment->SaveWeights( "wg.3.wgt" );  
  My_Experiment->WriteArrays( "arr.3.arr" );  
  My_Experiment->Decrement( "+,zw,A,rt,-,k,O,p,-,n,O,n,E" );  
  My_Experiment->Test( "dimin.test", "inc4.out" );
  My_Experiment->SaveWeights( "wg.4.wgt" );  
  My_Experiment->WriteArrays( "arr.4.arr" );  
  My_Experiment->Decrement( "=,=,=,=,+,k,e,=,-,r,@,l,T" );  
  My_Experiment->Test( "dimin.test", "inc5.out" );
  My_Experiment->SaveWeights( "wg.5.wgt" );  
  My_Experiment->WriteArrays( "arr.5.arr" );  
  delete My_Experiment;
  exit(1);
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}
